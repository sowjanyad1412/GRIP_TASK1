# GRIP_TASK1
The task aims to creating a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
â€ƒThe data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)
Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
Attribute Information:
sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
petal length in cm
petal width in cm
class:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolour
Iris Virginica
